# Chess Implementation in Java
This is a simple chess game implementation in Java using the Java Swing library. The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for playing chess against another human player on the same computer.

## Features 
* Play chess against another human player on the same computer
* Visual representation of the chessboard using Java Swing components
* Interactive piece movement and capture
* Checkmate detection, move Validation
* Enabling castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
* Ability to save and load the Played Game
* Possibility of manual placement of pieces before the start of the game
* Chess clock (using threads-without using a timer or a similar class with an implemented timer)

## How to Play
The game starts with an default placement of pieces on the chessboard.
To make a move, click on the piece you want to move and then click on the destination square.
Valid moves are highlighted in green.
If a move results in a checkmate, the game ends, and the winning player is displayed.

## Future Improvements
This chess game implementation is a basic version and can be enhanced in several ways. Here are some potential improvements:
* Player vs. Computer: Implement an AI player that can play against the human player. You can explore different AI algorithms and strategies, such as minimax with alpha-beta pruning or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to create a challenging computer opponent.
* Multiplayer Support: Implement network multiplayer functionality to allow players to play against opponents remotely over the internet. This can involve creating a server-client architecture or utilizing existing networking libraries.
* AI Analysis: Provide players with analysis tools to evaluate and analyze game positions. This can include features such as displaying suggested moves, highlighting potential threats, or providing game statistics and insights.
